## ðŸ§  Mental Model / Analogy
Think of this setup like building a city: the VPC is the city boundary, subnets are the neighborhoods, and services are the houses and businesses inside.


### ðŸ§  My Learning Experience
This week was both challenging and rewarding. I had to troubleshoot unexpected errors while configuring resources.
One key takeaway was that AWS services often require precise security group and IAM configurations to work together.
I also realized that breaking problems into smaller steps helped me debug faster.
